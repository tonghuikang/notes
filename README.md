### Quality Rating

I have rated the quality of my notetaking for your convenience.

⭐ Either it is barely readable, or that the content does not make sense without context.

⭐⭐ Some sections may be meaningful for the reader. Significant portions of content may be omitted or incomplete.

⭐⭐⭐ Probably the best note-taking effort (in markdown) that could reasonably be produced for the course.

❤️ Cheatsheet for at least one of the exams is available.



### How this is built

All files are stored in this [repository](https://github.com/tonghuikang/notes). This site is deployed with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to turn markdown (.md) files into .html files for web viewing. 

The notes were written on the [Typora](https://typora.io/) app. For editing and best viewing results, clone the repository and view it on the app. You can export to .html or .pdf from Typora. Snapshots of such exports is available on [OpenSUTD](https://opensutd.org/course-notes/).

Mathematical formulas is processed with [MathJax](https://tonghuikang.github.io/mathjax-experiment/), however the way it renders is sometimes different from Typora.
