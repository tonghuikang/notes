### How this is built

All files are stored in this [repository](https://github.com/tonghuikang/notes). This site is deployed with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to turn markdown (.md) files into .html files for web viewing. 

The notes were written on the [Typora](https://typora.io/) app. For editing and best viewing results, clone the repository and view it on the app. You can export to .html or .pdf from Typora. Snapshots of such exports is available on [OpenSUTD](https://opensutd.org/course-notes/).

Mathematical formulas is processed with [MathJax](https://tonghuikang.github.io/mathjax-experiment/), however the way it renders is sometimes different from Typora.



### Attribution

These summaries are from the courses that I have taken and is not my material. Any images should be assumed to be taken from the instructor's slides.



### Motivation

OpenSUTD has collated [course notes](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/course-notes) from contributing students.

Instead of hosting merely .pdfs or .docx, **I think we should make use of Github as the code hosting platform**. I wanted to write course notes only in  markdown so that changes can be tracked.

I would also like to see which part of my summaries has improved, and how has the material changed over the years. You would be doing me a favour if you improve on these set of notes :)



### Possible improvements

These are some aspects that I feel could be improved

- Accuracy. While I received a few comments on the SUTD notes, it has not been fully proofread.
- Reduced dependence on instructor's slides. For the more content heavy courses (e.g. Statistical Machine Learning or SML), many slides were lifted, and I hope to reduce on that.
- More summarised. This is not a replacement for course notes but rather summaries of the course notes, extracting important information that are used for revision and future reference.
