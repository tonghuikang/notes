# Course Notetaking
For some of the courses that I have taken in SUTD and SMU, I took down some of the content taught in the course, in markdown.

### Quality Rating

To better guide you to use this notes, I have rated the quality of my notetaking.

‚≠ê Either it is barely readable, or that the content does not make sense without context.

‚≠ê‚≠ê Some sections may be useful. Significant portions of content may be omitted.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Probably the best note-taking effort (in markdown) that could reasonably be produced for the course.

‚ù§Ô∏è Cheatsheet for any of the exams is available.

üî• The examinations allows the use of a cheatsheet, but I am still finding the cheatsheet.

When the examinations allows cheatsheet, I will spend more time on the cheatsheet usually at the expense of notetaking quality.



### How this is built

All files are stored in this [repository](https://github.com/tonghuikang/notes). This site is deployed with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to turn markdown (.md) files into .html files for web viewing. 

The notes were written on the [Typora](https://typora.io/) app. For editing and best viewing results, clone the repository and view it on the app. You can export to .html or .pdf from Typora. Snapshots of such exports is available on [OpenSUTD](https://opensutd.org/course-notes/).

Mathematical formulas is processed with [MathJax](https://tonghuikang.github.io/mathjax-experiment/), however the way it renders is sometimes different from Typora.



### Attribution

These summaries are from the courses that I have taken and is not my material. Any images should be assumed to be taken from the instructor's slides.



### Motivation

OpenSUTD has collated [course notes](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/course-notes) from contributing students.

Instead of hosting merely .pdfs or .docx, I want to share my notes in markdown. Feel free to edit from my notes in any way.









### Possible improvements

These are some aspects that I feel could be improved

- Accuracy. While I received a few comments on the SUTD notes, it has not been fully proofread.
- Reduced dependence on instructor's slides. For the more content heavy courses (e.g. Statistical Machine Learning or SML), many slides were lifted, and I hope to reduce on that.
- More summarised. This is not a replacement for course notes but rather summaries of the course notes, extracting important information that are used for revision and future reference.
- Add a forword to each course to summarise my thoughts on each course and what did I actually learn.
