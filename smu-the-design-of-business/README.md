## Business model

A business model describes the rationale of how an organisation creates, delivers and captures value.



The Business Model Canvas

![bmc](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Business_Model_Canvas.png/2560px-Business_Model_Canvas.png)

- **Components** (from right to left, then bottom, 9 components)
  - Customer Segments - that are served the organisation
  - Customer Relationships - how are relations established and maintained
  - Channels - how are value proposition delivered (communication, distribution, sales)
  - **Value Propositions** - how the firms solve customer problems and satisfy customer needs
  - Key Activities - what does the firm do to create and deliver the value)
  - Key Resources - the assets required to offer and deliver the described business model components
  - Key Partners - activities that are outsourced and acquired from outside the enterprise
  - Cost Structure - fixed and variable costs of resources and partnerships
  - Revenue Stream - means of generating revenue from customers and how this revenue stream is organised
- Right side - value (fill up the right side first)
- Left side - logic and efficiency



**Importance of the Business Model Canvas**

- Develop business model quickly
- Enable innovation - understand from where and affects what
- Defines value propositions and its meaning to the customer
- Iterate the model quickly
  - Quickly redesign components and linkages
  - Centered around the value proposition



<u>**7 Questions to assess your business model design**</u>

- **Switching costs** - nothing holding customers from leaving or are they locked in
- **Recurring Revenue** - transactional or automatically recurring
- **Earning vs Spending** - whether you earn your revenue before incurring COGS
- <u>**Game-changing cost structure**</u> - whether your cost structure higher or lower than your competitors (by 30%)
- **Others who do the work** - whether the value created in the business model is created for free by external parties, or are you responsible for all the value created in the business model
- <u>**Scalability**</u> - whether growing the business require substantial effort or is there no limits to growth
- **Protection from Competition** - whether are there "moats" that are hard to overcome by competitors

## BMC Innovation

Value Proposition Canvas

- Value proposition 
  - "the reason why customer turn to one company over another"
  - an aggregation/bundle of benefits a company offers customers
  - from a point of view of a particular group of users
  - may be similar to existing offers with additions, or may be innovative
- Value proposition canvas is a tool that allows you to design, test and visualise the value of your product for customers in a structured way
  - Value map (square)
    - Product and services - Name products and services your value proposition offers to get the job done
    - Pain relievers - Describe how your products and services can minimise or reduce the mentioned pains
    - Gains creators - Outline in which way your products and services create the gains
  - Customer profile (circle)
    - Customer jobs - List the functional, emotional and social jobs that your customers need to have done
    - Pains - Identify the blockages and problems your customers may face trying to get the jobs done

Business Model Innovation - Five Epicenters

- **Resource driven** - From organisation existing infrastructure or partnership (Amazon Web Services built on Amazon.com servers)
- **Offer driven** - Create new value propositions (IKEA low cost and fun furniture)
- **Customer driven** - Facilitated access or increased convenience based on customer needs (Zipcar disrupting car ownership)
- **Finance driven** - New revenue stream, pricing mechanism or reduced cost structures (Xerox leased photocopiers instead of selling it)
- **Multiple epicenter driven** - multiple epicenters (Hilti from selling tools to renting a set of tools, changes value proposition and revenue streams)



Archetype of Business Models

- **Unbundled** - unbundling customer relationship business, product innovation business and infrastructure business (e.g. private banking, telcom)

- **The Long Tail** - selling less of more product, require low inventory costs and strong platforms (Amazon.com and niche products)
- **Multi-sided Platforms** - bring together two or more distinct but interdependent groups of customers/parties, use of network effect (e.g. Apple App Store)
- **Freemium** - one substantial customer segment is able to continuously benefit from a free-of-charge offer (e.g. Zoom)
- **Open Business** - systematic way of creating and capturing value by collaborating with outside parties (e.g. P&G, pharma industry)



**Blue/Red Ocean Strategies**


 Red Ocean                                                 | Blue Ocean                                                
 --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- 
 Compete in existing market place                          | Create uncontested market space                           
 Beat the competition                                      | Make the competition irrelevant                           
 Exploit existing demand                                   | Create and capture new demand                             
 Make the value-cost trade-off                             | Break the value-cost trade-off                            
 Align firm with choice of differentiation **or** low cost | Align firm in pursuit of differentiation **and** low cost 

- Value innovation - increasing value and reducing cost
- Four actions framework
  - **Eliminate** (that your industry has long competed on)
  - **Raise** (well above the **<u>industry standard</u>**)
  - **Reduce** (well below the industry standard)
  - **Create** (something that the industry never offered)
- Cost Impact, Value Proposition Impact, Customer Impact (?)
