## Week 1 - 小说

小说 - Xiao-shuo: Chinese Conception of Fiction

What is fiction

- Imaginary characters and events, not true
- Narrow definition - written narratives in prose.
- Broad definition - imaginary stories in any format - films, songs or even video games

Why fiction is written

- Mode of expression
- Political and social commentary
- Invoke empathy and influence the common people

Why fiction is read

- Entertainment
- Social value - to connect with other people in the society
- To improve in language skills and storytelling skills

Characteristics of fiction

- Democractic - fiction is accessible by anyone
- Inclusive - the subject could be a beggar, prostitute or the empreror
- Universal - could be accessed by people from a different society or a different time
- Adaptable - can be adapted into different formats



Reading:

- “Hsiao-shuo” in The Indiana Companion to Traditional Chinese Literature, volume 1, page 423-426.
  - 说 - "shou" speak, "shui" persuade, "悦 yue" entertain (speech act)
  - Confucian scholars do not treat fiction seriously
    - 《汉书·艺文志》：“小说家者流，盖出于稗官，街谈巷语，道听途说者之所造也。”
      - "Street talk and alley gossip"
      - The authors are unknown, and stories are modified along the way.
      - Most fiction authors are unnamed until the Tang dynasty
    - 子曰：“虽小道，必有可观者焉，致远恐泥，是以君子弗为也。”
      - Gentlemen should not engage in fiction even if it is popular
    - Fiction was recorded to understand the populace.
  - The earilest Western texts are fiction (e.g. Greek epics). The earliest Chinese texts are philosophical.

Adaptation

- An acknowledged transposition of a recognisable work or works
- A creative and an interpretative act of appropriation of salvaging
- An extended intertextual engagement with the adapted work

Watch Hero 英雄 (or The Emperor and the Assassin) 

- See Wikipedia for sypnosis
- The concept of Chinese Hero
  - Honorable, Loyal
  - Sacrifice / willing to die for a cause
  - Righteous
  - Does not require success, or good martial arts
- Adaptations
  - Stories are loosely based on Chinese history. We know the context. We know the ending (i.e. spoilers) - we know who will die, and who will never die.
  - Since when do Chinese writers write fiction that is not meant to be the real history?

## Week 2 - History

Historiography, Historical Biography and the literary style of Chinese short fiction: Righteous Tragic Hero 

#### 《豫让》

- "The Assassin-Retainers, Memoir 26" in Sima Qian, translated by William H. Nienhauser. The Grand scribe’s Records. Volume VII The Memoirs of Pre-Han China (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994) pp. 319-334.

- The biography of Yu Jang 豫让《战国策·赵策一》
  - Yu Jang served the earl of Chih 智伯 who treated Yu Jang very well.
  - The earl was eliminated by Lord Hsiang 赵襄子, and Yu Jang vowed to take revenge - "士为知己者死,女为悦己者容" 
    - (性别美学 - reflects Chinese gender aesthetics)
  - The first assassination failed, while the lord's attendants wanted to execute Yu Jang, Lord Hsiang released him because he values Yu Jang's righteousness.
  - Yu Jang friend suggested that he could take revenge by offering his services to Lord Hsiang. Yu Jang rejected this recommendation because he want to bring shame to future betrayers. "亦将以愧天下后世人臣怀二心者"
    - (Motivation of addressing the future generation, he treated himself as a historical figure.)
  - The second assassination failed. Lord Hsiang allowed Yu Jang to strike his robes, and Yu Jang commit suicide.

Style of writing
- Factual and straightforward, chronologically
- Without describing how Yu Jang looks like, we know how he is like
- Important episodes and dialogue only to highlight character's characteristics
